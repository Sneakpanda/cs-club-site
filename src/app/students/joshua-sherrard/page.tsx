              Greetings, My name is Joshua Sherrard!
              <br />I am a freshman at the University of Northwestern - St. Paul
              and I am <b>Majoring in Computer Science and Cyber Security.</b>
              <br />I love playing video games and that is how I discovered my
              passion for technology. It wasn't until I took a game development
              class in highschool that I found my passion for coding.
            </p>
            <p className="w-1/2 pl-2 text-lg">
              I have experience in <b>Lua, Python and Java </b>
              but I am most experienced with Lua as that is what I have been
              using to develop my game development projects. I have been
              developing games as a hobby for about 2 years and I have made things
              like a fully playable roulette game, an audio file player for your
              PC, and incremental games. Read more about those down below.

          <p className="p-4"> Square Game is an Idle/Incremental game similar to Cookie Clicker.
             I have been actively working on Square Game since 12/25/24 and I was inspired for the idea after
             trying to make a square simply bounce around and collect dots. After completing the simulation I decided to keep
             adding to it and to make it a game.
          </p>
          <p className="p-4">
            I have been advertising Square Game on TikTok and Instagram since April 2025, and I have managed to amass <b>2,463 followers </b>
            across both platforms, as well as <b>1,623 wishlists</b> for the game in anticipation of its release. I plan to release a free demo
            for Square Game in early October to hopefully encourage more wishlists and I plan to release Square Game for purchase this year with
            many post-release updates.

          <h4 className="text-lg text-center"> Made with Lua in the Love2d Framework. </h4>
          <p className="p-4"> Lu[Idle] is an Idle/Incremental game very similar to Cookie Clicker and it is my very first video game I created. I started working on it as the final project
            for my in Intro to Game Development class I took in my junior year of highschool and after the class ended I decided to continue working on Lu[Idle].
            The premise of the game is that you are "coding" video games to then publish and use your earnings to make better video games.

          </p>
          <p className="p-4">
            There was only about 6 months that I was actually developing Lu[Idle] and after releasing the game onto Steam for $0.99, I sold 118 units and it made a gross income of $101. After taxes and Steam's 30% cut, I made a little over $50.
            I then made Lu[Idle] free to play after realising that I didn't need the money that it would be making me and I would rather just have more people be able to play the game. In total it was played by 2,006 unique
            users and 520 of which have had the game open for over 10 hours. I eventually stopped working on Lu[Idle] because I lacked motivation to work on it. As it was my first ever game I designed, the coding was super bad and poorly orginized
             so that made working on it even harder. I am proud of the success of Lu[Idle] and for what it is, I am happy to see that 65% of the 29 reviews, it has on Steam, are positive.
            Feel free to try it out, it's free!

          <p className="p-4">
            WheelBound is the game of Roulette turned into a program that you can play for fun. There is zero real money involved
            and you always start the game with $1000 to use as you please. You can switch chips with the 1, 2, and 3 keys to switch between 5, 10, and 100 respectively and then hit space to spin the wheel.
            WheelBound was originally going to be a Roulette Rogue Like.
             But I gave up, as turning roulette into a Rogue Like posed too many challenges to be worth the time it would take me.

          <p className="p-4">
            The SoundBack is pretty much an MP3 player except for a few key features. When you open the app you wont be able to do anything until you drag and drop an audio file into it.
            You will then be able to toggle whether it is playing or not and change the volume. You are also able to play multiple audios at a time and they will loop infinitly.
            But dont worry, if you close the game, your audio files will save in the app.
